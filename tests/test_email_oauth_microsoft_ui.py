"""Regression coverage for the Microsoft OAuth wiring in the email account forms.

`static/js/settings.js` renders two email account forms — the Settings account
form (`eaf-` ids) and the first-run setup form (`uf-` ids). Both must offer the
Microsoft connect flow for the Outlook / Office 365 preset, and neither may
hardcode Google as the provider the connect button authorizes against.

The module pulls in the DOM and a dozen sibling modules, so these read the
source rather than booting it — the same idiom as
`test_note_reminder_email_oauth.py` for this file.
